## Current Progress Update

We've made significant progress on Phase 1: VS Code Foundation, specifically on task 1.2 (Create custom branding and theming).

### Completed:

- Created and implemented custom application icons (mudlabs.ico, mudlabs.icns)
- Replaced the main application icons for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Updated the bundle identifier in product.json to "com.mudlabs.app"
- Successfully built and tested the application with new branding

### Currently Working On:

- Replacing the welcome screen letterpress SVG images with Mudlabs branding
- Need to create four versions of the letterpress SVG for different themes:
  - letterpress-light.svg (for light theme)
  - letterpress-dark.svg (for dark theme)
  - letterpress-hcLight.svg (for high contrast light theme)
  - letterpress-hcDark.svg (for high contrast dark theme)

### Next Steps:

- Complete the welcome screen branding
- Update any remaining VS Code branding references in the UI
- Move on to task 1.3: Build custom welcome page and dashboard

The application is now building successfully with the new icons, but we need to complete the UI branding elements before moving to the next task.

## Development Guidelines

### VS Code Customization

- Maintain compatibility with VS Code extensions
- Use VS Code's extension API for custom functionality
- Follow VS Code's UI patterns for consistency
- Implement custom views using VS Code's webview API
- Preserve core VS Code functionality

### Template Development

- Each template must include:
  - Authentication and user management
  - Team collaboration features
  - Subscription and payment processing
  - Responsive design (mobile-first)
  - Comprehensive documentation
- Templates should be customizable without breaking core functionality
- Use a consistent component library across templates
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for all template code
- Follow accessibility best practices

### AI Integration

- AI should understand the context of each template
- Provide template-specific suggestions and assistance
- Generate code that follows template patterns and best practices
- Assist with customization and extension of templates
- Help troubleshoot common SaaS development issues

### Performance Requirements

- Application startup time < 3 seconds
- Template preview loading < 2 seconds
- Template installation < 30 seconds
- AI response time < 1 second
- Smooth UI interactions (60fps)

### Security Considerations

- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Proper authentication for marketplace and updates
- Code scanning for security vulnerabilities
- Secure communication with external services
- Regular security audits and updates
